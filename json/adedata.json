          "intro": "ADE Community Based Organization (ADE CBO) is a registered, community-led non-profit in Kibera, Nairobi. Founded in 2018 by Adriano Situma and Daniel Ogweno, ADE CBO began as a response to the urgent needs of girls in the slums—especially those missing school due to poverty and lack of basic supplies. What started as a small initiative has grown into a movement using football as a bridge to education, mentorship, and dignity. Today, we empower children and youth through sports, education, health, and community support, addressing the root causes of poverty and exclusion.",
